description: "Governance infrastructure for automated decisions"
---

MeshQu provides governance infrastructure for automated and AI-assisted decisions that must follow explicit policy. Integrate MeshQu into your application to evaluate transactions, operations, or events against configurable policies and receive structured decisions.

**Key concepts:** [Decision context](concepts/overview#decision-context) · [Policy](concepts/overview#policy) · [Decision](concepts/overview#decision) · [Alert](concepts/overview#alert)

## What MeshQu does

You send a **decision context** (the data describing what is about to happen). MeshQu evaluates it against your active **policies** and returns a **decision**: `ALLOW`, `REVIEW`, `DENY`, or `ALERT`, along with any violations.

Your application decides what to do with the decision. MeshQu does not block or allow anything on its own — it provides the verdict and your code acts on it.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.meshqu.com/v1/decisions/evaluate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-MeshQu-Tenant-Id: YOUR_TENANT_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "context": {
      "decision_type": "trade_execution",
      "fields": { "account_id": "ACC-001", "instrument": "AAPL", "quantity": 100 }
    }
  }'
```

```json
{
  "result": {
    "decision": "ALLOW",
    "violations": [],
    "rules_evaluated": 3
  }
}
```

## Key capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Policy evaluation** | Evaluate a context against one or many policies in a single call. |
| **Decision recording** | Persist evaluation results for audit and compliance. |
| **Idempotent recording** | Supply an `idempotency_key` to safely retry without duplicate records. |
| **Alert webhooks** | Receive real-time notifications when alerts are raised. |
| **Multi-tenant** | Every request is scoped to a tenant via the `X-MeshQu-Tenant-Id` header. |
| **Scoped API keys** | Fine-grained access control with per-key scopes. |
