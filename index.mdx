MeshQu provides governance infrastructure for policy-aware decisions. Integrate MeshQu into your application to evaluate transactions, operations, or events against configurable policies and receive structured decisions.

## What MeshQu does

You send a **decision context** (the data describing what is about to happen). MeshQu evaluates it against your active **policies** and returns a **decision**: `ALLOW`, `REVIEW`, `DENY`, or `ALERT`, along with any violations.

Your application decides what to do with the decision. MeshQu does not block or allow anything on its own — it provides the verdict and your code acts on it.

## Key capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Policy evaluation** | Evaluate a context against one or many policies in a single call. |
| **Decision recording** | Persist evaluation results for audit and compliance. |
| **Idempotent recording** | Supply an `idempotency_key` to safely retry without duplicate records. |
| **Alert webhooks** | Receive real-time notifications when alerts are raised. |
| **Multi-tenant** | Every request is scoped to a tenant via the `X-MeshQu-Tenant-Id` header. |
| **Scoped API keys** | Fine-grained access control with per-key scopes. |
