## Transport security

All production traffic must use HTTPS (TLS 1.2+). The API rejects plain HTTP in production environments.

## Authentication

- API keys are transmitted via the `Authorization: Bearer` header.
- Keys are hashed before storage — MeshQu never stores plaintext keys.
- Keys support expiry and revocation. Revoked keys are rejected immediately.
- See [Authentication](../getting-started/authentication) for details.

## Multi-tenant isolation

Every API request is scoped to a tenant via the `X-MeshQu-Tenant-Id` header. Data from one tenant is never accessible to another. The API key must belong to the specified tenant.

## Scoped access

API keys carry explicit scopes that limit what operations they can perform. Follow the principle of least privilege: issue keys with only the scopes each service needs.

## Webhook security

- Webhook payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256.
- Signatures include a timestamp for replay protection (5-minute window).
- Webhook delivery follows redirects cautiously to mitigate SSRF risks.
- See [Webhooks](../guides/webhooks) for verification details.

## Audit trail

All significant actions (policy changes, decision recordings, key operations) are logged to an append-only audit trail. Audit events can be verified for integrity via the API.

## Rate limiting

Two-tier rate limiting protects against abuse:

- **Pre-authentication**: IP-based limits prevent brute-force attempts.
- **Post-authentication**: Per-tenant limits ensure fair usage.

## Correlation IDs

Every request is assigned a `correlation_id` returned in the response body and as the `x-correlation-id` header. Use this for tracing and when contacting support.

## Data you send to MeshQu

Decision contexts (`fields`, `metadata`, `evidence`) are sent by your application. You control what data is included. Follow the principle of **data minimisation**: send only the fields your policies need to make a decision. Avoid sending sensitive personally identifiable information unless required by your policies. Use opaque identifiers (account IDs, order IDs) rather than raw personal data where possible.

## What MeshQu stores

- **Evaluate** (`/v1/decisions/evaluate`): Nothing is persisted. The evaluation is stateless.
- **Record** (`/v1/decisions/record`): The decision context, decision, violations, and metadata are stored for audit.

## Data usage

MeshQu does not train models or derive secondary data from customer decision contexts.

## Responsible disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, contact security@meshqu.com. Do not disclose publicly until a fix is available.
