title: "Trust Model"
description: "How MeshQu cryptographically guarantees the integrity, authenticity, and transparency of every governed decision."
---

MeshQu implements a four-level trust maturity model. Each level builds on the previous, adding stronger cryptographic guarantees. The current deployment operates at **Level 2**.

## Level 0 — Deterministic Integrity

<Info>Status: **Active**</Info>

Every decision produces an identical hash when replayed with the same inputs.

**Capabilities:**
- SHA-256 integrity hashing of all decision inputs, outputs, and policy snapshots
- Canonical JSON serialisation for reproducible computation
- Replay verification — recompute and compare at any time
- Frozen policy snapshots bound to each decision

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Hash algorithm | SHA-256 |
| Canonicalisation | Recursive key-sort + JSON.stringify |
| Replay endpoint | `GET /v1/decisions/{id}/replay` |

**What this proves:** The decision record has not been altered since it was created.

---

## Level 1 — Cryptographic Signatures

<Info>Status: **Active**</Info>

Decisions are signed — tampering is detectable without any API call.

**Capabilities:**
- Ed25519 digital signature on every decision receipt
- Key versioning (`msk_v1`) with documented rotation runbook
- Offline verification — no network call required to validate
- Current + previous key support for graceful rotation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Signature algorithm | Ed25519 (RFC 8032) |
| Key format | SPKI DER, base64-encoded |
| Key ID | `msk_v1` |
| Verification | Web Crypto API / Node.js crypto |

**What this proves:** The decision was issued by MeshQu and has not been modified.

## Level 2 — Transparency Anchoring

<Tip>This is the **current** deployment level.</Tip>

Even if MeshQu disappears, receipts remain independently verifiable.

**Capabilities:**
- Anchored to [Sigstore Rekor](https://rekor.sigstore.dev) — a public, immutable transparency log
- DSSE envelope with in-toto attestation statement
- Merkle tree inclusion proofs for tamper-evident ordering
- Graceful degradation — signing is never blocked by log availability

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Transparency log | Sigstore Rekor (`rekor.sigstore.dev`) |
| Entry format | DSSE envelope + in-toto statement |
| Proof type | Merkle tree inclusion proof |
| Degradation | Signed but unanchored if Rekor unreachable |

<Note>
**Why DSSE, not hashedrekord?** Ed25519 is incompatible with Rekor's `hashedrekord` entry type ([sigstore/rekor#851](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/issues/851)). MeshQu uses DSSE envelopes with in-toto attestation statements instead.
</Note>

**What this proves:** The decision existed at a specific point in time, anchored in a public, append-only log that MeshQu cannot retroactively alter.

---

## Level 3 — Hardware-Bound Identity

<Warning>Status: **Planned** — available on engagement basis.</Warning>

Signing keys never leave secure hardware.

**Capabilities:**
- Hardware security modules (HSM) or Cloud KMS for key storage
- Agent-level identity binding — each agent gets its own attested key
- Attestation chains linking decisions to specific hardware enclaves
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ compliance path

**What this proves:** Cryptographic operations are performed within tamper-resistant hardware, providing the highest assurance that keys have not been extracted or cloned.

## How to Verify

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Web Verifier" icon="shield-check" href="https://verify.meshqu.com">
    Paste any decision receipt JSON. Integrity hash, signature, and transparency anchor are validated in your browser — no API call, no authentication.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verification CLI" icon="terminal">
    Open-source command-line tool for independent receipt verification. **Coming soon.**

    ```bash
    npx meshqu-verify receipt.json
    ```

## Why Sigstore Rekor?

Rekor is a free, public, immutable transparency log operated by the [Sigstore project](https://www.sigstore.dev) under the Linux Foundation. It uses the same Merkle tree technology behind Certificate Transparency — the system that secures billions of HTTPS connections.

By anchoring decision receipts to Rekor, MeshQu creates a tamper-evident record that exists independently of our infrastructure.
