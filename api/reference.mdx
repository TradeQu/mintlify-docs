Base path: `/v1`

**Determinism guarantee:** Given the same decision context and the same policy snapshot, MeshQu will always return the same verdict. The `policy_snapshot_hash` and `integrity_hash` in each response let you verify this independently. Determinism applies to policy evaluation, not to external data sources supplied by the client.

All authenticated endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` and `X-MeshQu-Tenant-Id` headers. See [Authentication](../getting-started/authentication).
