<Warning>
  The MeshQu SDK is in early access and not yet publicly distributed. Contact [contact@meshqu.com](mailto:contact@meshqu.com) for access.
</Warning>

MeshQu provides an official TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for integrating with the API.

| Package | Language | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@tradequ/meshqu-client` | TypeScript / JavaScript | Early access — contact us |

The SDK handles:

- Authentication header injection.
- Tenant header injection.
- Typed request and response objects.
- Automatic error mapping to typed exception classes.
- Configurable timeouts and retries.

## When to use the SDK vs. raw HTTP

Use the **SDK** when you are working in a Node.js or TypeScript environment. It removes boilerplate and provides compile-time type safety.

Use **raw HTTP** when you are calling from a language without an official SDK, or from infrastructure tooling (CI pipelines, shell scripts, etc.).

## Other languages

A Python SDK is coming soon. In the meantime, use the REST API directly with `httpx` or `requests`. See the [API Reference](../api/reference) for endpoint details.

Additional SDKs for other languages are planned depending on demand. If you need SDK support for a specific language, contact [contact@meshqu.com](mailto:contact@meshqu.com).
