MeshQu provides an official TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for integrating with the API.

| Package | Language | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@tradequ/meshqu-client` | TypeScript / JavaScript | `npm install @tradequ/meshqu-client` |

The SDK handles:

- Authentication header injection.
- Tenant header injection.
- Typed request and response objects.
- Automatic error mapping to typed exception classes.
- Configurable timeouts and retries.

## When to use the SDK vs. raw HTTP

Use the **SDK** when you are working in a Node.js or TypeScript environment. It removes boilerplate and provides compile-time type safety.

Use **raw HTTP** when you are calling from a language without an official SDK, or from infrastructure tooling (CI pipelines, shell scripts, etc.).

## No Python SDK

There is currently no official Python SDK. Use the REST API directly from Python with `httpx` or `requests`. See the [API Reference](../api/reference) for endpoint details.
