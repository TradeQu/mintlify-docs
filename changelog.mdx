description: "API version history"

MeshQu follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The current API version is **v1.1.0**.

## Versioning policy

- **Major** (`v2.x`): Breaking changes to request/response contracts or authentication. Announced with a migration guide and deprecation period.
- **Minor** (`v1.2`): New endpoints, fields, or features. Backwards-compatible.
- **Patch** (`v1.1.1`): Bug fixes and performance improvements. No contract changes.

## Stability guarantees

- Existing response fields are never removed or renamed within a major version.
- New optional fields may be added to responses at any time — clients should ignore unknown fields.
- Webhook payload schemas follow the same policy.

## API version header

All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1`. When a new major version is released, the previous version will remain available for a documented deprecation period.

## v1.2.0

- Added conditional rule applicability (`when` clause on policy rules).
- Rules with a `when` clause are only evaluated when the clause matches the decision context. Non-matching rules return NA (not applicable) with a human-readable reason on the decision receipt.
- New optional fields on `EvaluationResult`: `rules_na` (count) and `na_rules` (details).
- Supported `when` operators: `equals`, `in`, `exists`, with `all`/`any` combinators for nested logic.
- Snapshot hash includes `when` clauses (backward compatible — existing hashes unchanged).

## v1.1.0

- Added policy groups (CRUD + listing policies within a group).
- Added alert webhook subscriptions with HMAC-signed delivery.
- Added webhook delivery history and statistics endpoints.
- Added decision SSE stream (`GET /v1/decisions/stream`).
- Added audit log verification (`POST /v1/audit-log/verify`).
- Added API key naming (`key_name`) for audit attribution.
- Added advisory mode for policies.
- Added two-tier rate limiting (pre-auth + post-auth).

## v1.0.1

Production hardening release. All fixes are backwards-compatible at the HTTP layer.

- SDK `apiKey` configuration is now required (throws a clear error if missing).
- `idempotency_key` is now required when recording decisions (no longer auto-generated).
- Added `dryRun()` as a semantic alias for `evaluate()`.
- Recorded decisions now capture audit attribution (`api_key_id`, `api_key_name`).
- Infrastructure failures (database, pool exhaustion) now return `503 Service Unavailable` with `retry_after` instead of `500`.
- `SKIP_AUTH` environment variable is ignored in production with a security warning.

## v1.0.0

- Initial release.
- Policy CRUD with immutable versioning.
- Decision evaluation (dry-run) and recording (persisted).
- Decision replay for audit verification.
- Alert listing and acknowledgement.
- API key management with scoped access.
- Audit event listing.
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec and Swagger UI.
