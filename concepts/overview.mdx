This page introduces the key abstractions you will work with when integrating MeshQu.

## Decision context

A **decision context** is the payload you send to MeshQu describing what is about to happen. It contains:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `decision_type` | A string identifying the kind of operation (e.g. `trade_execution`, `withdrawal`). |
| `fields` | Domain-agnostic values the policies evaluate (account, amount, instrument, etc.). |
| `metadata` | Optional key-value pairs for traceability (source system, request ID, etc.). |
| `evidence` | Optional supporting data that policies may reference during evaluation. |
| `source_artifact` | Optional cryptographic binding to a source document (hash + metadata). |

## Policy

A **policy** is a named, versioned governance rule that MeshQu evaluates against incoming decision contexts. Policies have:

- A unique `code` (human-readable identifier).
- A `shadow_mode` flag: when enabled, `DENY` decisions are downgraded to `ALERT` for observation.
- One or more **versions**. Only the active version is used during evaluation.

You manage policies via the API or the MeshQu Console.

### Policy groups

Policies can be organised into **policy groups** for batch management. A decision context may be evaluated against all policies in a group.

## Decision

Every evaluation returns a **decision**:

| Decision | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ALLOW` | All evaluated policies passed. Proceed normally. |
| `REVIEW` | One or more policies flagged the context for manual review. |
| `DENY` | One or more policies rejected the context. |
| `ALERT` | A shadow-mode policy would have denied; logged for observation. |

The decision is **advisory**. Your application decides what to do with it — MeshQu does not block or allow operations on its own.

## Violation

When a policy does not pass, it produces one or more **violations**. Each violation includes:

- `rule_code` — which rule raised it.
- `reason` — a human-readable explanation.
- `severity` — how serious the violation is.

## Decision (recorded)

A **decision** is a persisted evaluation result. You create one by calling `/v1/decisions/record` with an `idempotency_key`. Recorded decisions support:

- Retrieval by ID or listing with filters.
- Replay for audit verification.
- Linking to alerts.

## Alert

An **alert** is raised when notable conditions are detected (e.g. a critical policy failure). Alerts have a `severity` (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`) and can be acknowledged. You can subscribe to alert webhooks for real-time notification.

## Tenant

All data is isolated per **tenant**. Every API request includes a `X-MeshQu-Tenant-Id` header, and the API key must belong to that tenant.

## How these fit together
